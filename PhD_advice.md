### PhD advice

The following list defines our advice for a potential PhD student which extends to cover the full range of the PhD programme where:

1. it is incumbent upon the student to be certain of their chosen research subject, and also its relevance within its native academic, commercial or other environment. In connection with this, it may be advisable that the student has several research subjects in mind at this time. 
2. With this basis established, the student must carefully select their supervisor(s). 
3. Both supervisor(s) and student must now define the boundaries of their work within the aforementioned environment.
4. It follows that a plan of work must be developed within the first year. Henceforth, the student must remain focused upon this plan and not be side-tracked by unnecessary or excessive detail which may cause delay.
5. This can be prevented by the student maintaining regular contact with their supervisor(s) to ensure that the plan is being followed,
6. but the student should also be prepared to disagree with their supervisor(s) given good reason.
7. It is also sensible for the student to maintain an amicable relationship with their supervisor(s).
8. The student should also be aware of work related to their own,
9. and in connection with this, seek to build up a network of contacts through published work in journals and conferences.
10. This networking requires that the student must be prepared, and understand the need, to criticise related work and accept criticism of, and be ready to defend, their own work especially when their viva voce takes place.
11. It may also be useful for the student to familiarise themselves with the work of the external examiners adjudicating their viva.
12. Further advice to a potential PhD student concerns the necessary application, patience and tolerance required to complete the PhD programme, despite the inevitable doubts, and consequent temptation to abandon their work.
13. The student should also be aware of the seemingly ever-increasing amount of time required by the PhD programme for research work and thesis writing/revising up to the moment of final submission.
14. ahahaha
